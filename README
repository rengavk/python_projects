# Energy Generation Analysis & Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explores and forecasts energy generation, load, and price trends using historical time-series data. I perform data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and visualization to uncover patterns and support planning decisions in the energy sector.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Modeling:** ARIMA, Prophet, regression techniques  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## ðŸ”„ Workflow / Pipeline  
1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ load historical energy dataset (generation, load, price)  
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handle missing values, outlier removal, data type conversion  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ visualize trends, correlations, seasonality  
4. **Feature Engineering** â€“ create lag features, rolling means, time-based features  
5. **Modeling & Forecasting** â€“ build ARIMA / Prophet models, compare performance  
6. **Evaluation** â€“ assess forecast accuracy (MAE, RMSE)  
7. **Visualization** â€“ plot actual vs predicted, residual analysis

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings & Insights  
- The dataset shows clear **seasonal and daily cycles** in energy generation and load.  
- Forecast models (Prophet, ARIMA) capture these cycles fairly well; residuals indicate some unexplained volatility.  
- Feature engineering (lag features, rolling windows) improved forecast accuracy by reducing error metrics.  
- Visualizing forecast errors over time reveals periods of higher uncertainty, highlighting where model improvements are needed.
